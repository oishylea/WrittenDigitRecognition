# Written Digit RecognitionðŸ”¢

This project implements a handwritten digit recognition system using Python and TensorFlow. The model is trained on the MNIST dataset, which consists of images of handwritten digits. The project also demonstrates how to preprocess images created with Paint for recognition.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language for implementing the model.
- **TensorFlow**: Deep learning framework to build and train the neural network.
- **Paint**: Used for creating custom handwritten digit images.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a model that can accurately recognize handwritten digits from images. The steps involved include:

1. **Dataset Preparation**: Utilize the MNIST dataset for training and testing the model.
2. **Image Preprocessing**: Prepare and normalize images, including those created with Paint.
3. **Model Building**: Construct a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for digit classification.
4. **Training**: Train the model with the MNIST dataset.
5. **Testing**: Evaluate the model's performance on test data and custom images.
